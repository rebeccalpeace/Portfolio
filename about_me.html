        <h3>background</h3>
        <p>I was born in Lake Jackson, TX and raised in Austin, TX for most of my life.
             I attended <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/" target="_blank">UT Austin</a> and received a double major in Studio Art and Geography. 
             After college, I obtained a certification to teach in Texas and taught 
             elementary music for three years. As exciting as this was, it wasn't the right 
             career choice for me, so I went back to school to get a nursing degree from
             UTMB. During these last four years, I have been nursing in different hospital units, 
             from med/surg to labor and delivery. I am currently living in Philadelphia, PA with 
             my boyfriend and beloved cat, Peepee.

        <h3>why web dev</h3>
        <p>After being an RN for four years, I've had enough experience to know that I am 
            not passionate about nursing. I took a beginning web development course at NuCamp
            in May 2022 and I really enjoyed what I learned about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            I am excited about what a career in web development has to offer: creativity, 
            flexibility, camaraderie, and a challenging, yet fulfilling experience.
